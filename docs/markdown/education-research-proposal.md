## 9. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### 9.1 Market and Competition Risks

**Risk: Canvas/Instructure integration rejection**

*Probability*: Medium (35%)
*Impact*: High - Limits addressable market

*Mitigation*:
- Develop as LTI 1.3 standard integration (not proprietary)
- Build business case for Instructure (data monetization, feature ecosystem)
- Have fallback to Blackboard/Brightspace integrations
- Consider acquisition as strategic outcome

**Risk: Rapid technological change in AI/LLMs**

*Probability*: High (60%)
*Impact*: Medium - Core RAG technology may be commoditized

*Mitigation*:
- Differentiation through formal verification, not just RAG
- Build defensible IP in formal verification integration
- Partner with research institutions for algorithm development
- Continuous R&D investment (25-30% of revenue)

**Risk: Open-source alternatives emerge**

*Probability*: Medium (40%)
*Impact*: Medium-High - Price compression

*Mitigation*:
- Build for institutions with support/compliance requirements
- Formal verification as defensible moat
- Institutional partnerships reduce switching cost
- High-touch service delivery

### 9.2 Product and Technical Risks

**Risk: Formal verification integration complexity**

*Probability*: Medium-High (50%)
*Impact*: High - Critical to differentiation

*Mitigation*:
- Start with simplified verification (computational reproducibility)
- Build relationships with Stanford Centaur lab and theorem proving community
- Prototype extensively before full release
- Partner approach: license verification engines rather than build

**Risk: FERPA compliance failures**

*Probability*: Low (15%)
*Impact*: Very High - Litigation, market rejection

*Mitigation*:
- Hire FERPA compliance expert (Month 1)
- External audit every 6 months
- Build compliance into architecture, not bolted-on
- Insurance for compliance failures
- Conservative data retention/minimization

**Risk: Data security and privacy breaches**

*Probability*: Medium (25%)
*Impact*: Very High - Reputational and financial

*Mitigation*:
- SOC 2 Type II certification (Month 12)
- Regular penetration testing (quarterly)
- Zero-trust architecture
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Bug bounty program (Month 18)

### 9.3 Commercial and Adoption Risks

**Risk: Slow institutional adoption cycles**

*Probability*: Medium (40%)
*Impact*: Medium - Delayed revenue

*Mitigation*:
- Target early-adopter institutions first
- Build advocates among faculty and researchers
- Low switching cost through standards (LTI)
- Free tier for research use cases
- Student/educational licensing to build adoption

**Risk: Unable to achieve sufficient research data quality**

*Probability*: Medium-High (45%)
*Impact*: High - Verification services lose credibility

*Mitigation*:
- Conservative initial scope (computational reproducibility only)
- Academic partnerships for validation
- Publish research on verification approaches
- Beta test extensively before production
- Transparent about limitations

**Risk: Tier-1 research universities prefer custom solutions**

*Probability*: Medium (35%)
*Impact*: Medium - High-value customer loss

*Mitigation*:
- Customization and extensibility built into platform
- Partner approach: augment vs. replace
- Institutional pricing with flexibility
- Co-development opportunities

### 9.4 Regulatory and Compliance Risks

**Risk: Educational regulations change (accreditation, accessibility)**

*Probability*: Medium (30%)
*Impact*: Medium - Feature development required

*Mitigation*:
- Accessibility compliance built-in (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Partnership with accreditation bodies
- Modular architecture to adapt to requirements
- Legal and compliance expertise on team

**Risk: AI/LLM regulations evolve**

*Probability*: High (65%)
*Impact*: Medium - May require feature limitations

*Mitigation*:
- Monitor regulatory landscape (EU AI Act, etc.)
- Transparency in AI use
- User opt-in for generative features
- Alternative non-AI approaches available

### 9.5 Financial and Operational Risks

**Risk: Funding challenges for ambitious product roadmap**

*Probability*: Medium (35%)
*Impact*: High - Delayed scaling

*Mitigation*:
- Bootstrap with initial customers and partnership revenue
- Strategic partnerships with Canvas, Blackboard, Microsoft
- Grant funding from NSF, NIH for research software quality
- Acquisition as exit strategy

**Risk: Talent acquisition and retention**

*Probability*: Medium (40%)
*Impact*: High - Technical roadmap delays

*Mitigation*:
- Competitive compensation (top quartile)
- Build around mission (improving research quality)
- Located in talent-dense area (Stanford/Bay Area presence)
- Academic partnerships for research sabbaticals
